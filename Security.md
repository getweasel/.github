# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in any of the Weasel software components,
please privately report it to us at <hello@getweasel.com> first.

This will allow us to assess the risk and make a fix available before we
add it to our public issue tracker.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
